    Generate 5 different professional SVG visualizations suitable for business storytelling based on the following text. 
    Each visualization should help communicate business concepts effectively and maintain a professional aesthetic.
    
    Consider these visualization types:

    - Concept maps and hierarchies
    - Icon-based infographics
    
    Return the response as a JSON array where each item has 'description' and 'svg_code' keys.
